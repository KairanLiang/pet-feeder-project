Problem statement:
Design a low-cost, programmable pet feeder that feeds pets at predetermined times, monitors the amount of food consumed, and alerts employees of problems.
The features must include:
1. The automatic pet feeder should dispense food at the scheduled time.
2.Check to see if the pet has consumed the food.
3.Sound an alarm if not fed or if the pet has not eaten the food.
Assumption: the feeder does not distinguish between cat and dog food. Food out time is fixed at 8:00AM and 6:00PM
Limitations: limited memory to store too much data, need to be cleaned regularly. Relies on manual setting.
Inputs: real time clock, food level sensor, under bowl weight sensor.
Outputs: rotary motor, alarms.
